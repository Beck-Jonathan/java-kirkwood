# Java Kirkwood 2023

This is the work I completed for my CIS-171 Java course at Kirkwood Community
College. Below is a journal of all the things I learned throughout 
the class.

## Introduction

In the Introduction unit we created accounts and installed software 
needed for the class.

Using [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) we created a module with a **Java class** inside it. 
Inside the class we created a main method that displays a message in
the terminal. We can type "sout" followed by the tab key to generate 
the `System.out.println()` statement.

```java
public class MyClass {
public static void main(String[] args) {
System.out.println("My name is Jonathan!");
}
}
```
We initialized our project as a [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) **repository* and pushed our
project code to [GitHub](https://www.github.com/signup/). Our project includes a **.gitignore** 
file telling Git which files not to track.

Going forward, whenever I complete a task I will **Add-Commit-Push (ACP)**

- git add .
- git commit -m "describe my work"
- git push origin main :rocket:
